             SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM PROOF                  
========================================================

1. PACKAGE TIMER CALCULATION PROOF
--------------------------------------------------------
If a school subscribes today (2026-02-25):

Package: 'Paket Silver'
- Timer set to: 30 days
- Expiration Date calculated as: 2026-03-26

Package: 'Paket Gold'
- Timer set to: 180 days
- Expiration Date calculated as: 2026-08-23

Package: 'Paket Platinum'
- Timer set to: 360 days
- Expiration Date calculated as: 2027-02-19

2. ACTIVE SUBSCRIPTION ENFORCEMENT PROOF
--------------------------------------------------------
Current System Date: 2026-02-25

When checking if a school has an active subscription, the system 
runs this EXACT SQL query on the database:

select * from `subscriptions` where `school_id` = ? and date(`start_date`) <= ? and date(`end_date`) >= ? order by `created_at` desc

SQL Bindings sent to database:
Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 2026-02-25
    [2] => 2026-02-25
)

CONCLUSION:
Notice the condition: `end_date` >= '2026-02-25'
The database will ONLY return a subscription if its end_date has not passed.
The moment tomorrow's date arrives, '2026-02-25' becomes the next day, 
and the database will return empty (null) for expired packages, immediately locking features.
